Automated Defect Detection

This project is for automated defect detection on upper mating surface of cylinder block(CB) for engine assembling production. 
This is privet project so no examples, images or photos will be present. It's a trade secret.
All algorithmes will work on Ruspberry PI4B + HQ Raspberry camera module 16mm.

First part is just making photo on event (CB moves under camera). Already tested, workes well. If you will use it for your perpuse some
constants and thresholdes have to be adjusted.
